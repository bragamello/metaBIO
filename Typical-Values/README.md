# Cortical typical values
Bayesian model comparison developed to explore novel morphological variables, called K, I, and S. This code is part of the work pre-published at https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.10.22272228v2

This code implements a straightforward harmonization procedure on cortical morphological variables to remove type B errors which naturally arises due to heterogeneous data acquisition and processing.
